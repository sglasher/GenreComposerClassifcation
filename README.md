## Background

Provide a bit of background on the motivation for your project. Mention any related work in the field of music analysis and classification, especially those using CNNs and LSTMs. Explain how your project builds upon or differs from existing approaches.

## Dataset

Describe the dataset you used for training and testing your model. Mention the source of the MIDI files, the number of composers, the number of MIDI files per composer, and any preprocessing steps you performed on the data (such as MIDI to numerical data conversion).

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up and install the project on someone else's machine. Include any dependencies that need to be installed and how to install them (e.g., using `pip`). You can also mention any specific hardware or software requirements.

## Usage

Explain how to use your project once it's installed. Provide code examples or commands for running the composer classification process using your trained CNN and LSTM model. If you have any configurable parameters, explain how to modify them for experimentation.

## Results

Present the results of your classification experiment. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant metrics you used to evaluate the performance of your model. You could include graphs or visualizations to help illustrate your results.

## Future Enhancements

Discuss any potential improvements or future directions for your project. This could include ideas for enhancing the model, incorporating more advanced techniques, expanding the dataset, or exploring different aspects of music analysis using MIDI files.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project if they're interested. This could involve providing guidelines for code contributions, bug reports, feature requests, and other ways people can get involved in the project's development.

## License

Specify the license under which your project is released. Choose an appropriate open-source license that aligns with your project's goals.

## Contact Information

Provide a way for users to get in touch with you if they have questions, feedback, or want to collaborate. This could be an email address, a link to your GitHub profile, or any other preferred method of communication.

Remember, a good README should be clear, concise, and informative. Customize the sections as needed to fit your project's specifics. Good luck with your composer classification project!
